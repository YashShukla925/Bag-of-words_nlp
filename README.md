# Bag of Words Model using NLP

This repository contains the implementation of a **Bag of Words (BoW)** model, a fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to represent text data. The BoW model is commonly used for tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and more.

## Overview

The **Bag of Words** model is a simple and effective way to convert text into numerical features. In this approach, each document is represented as a vector of word frequencies or occurrences, disregarding grammar and word order but keeping multiplicity.

This implementation allows you to preprocess text data, convert it into a BoW representation, and use it for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and tokenize text data.
- **Vocabulary Creation**: Build a vocabulary of unique words from the text corpus.
- **Vectorization**: Convert text documents into numerical vectors.
- **Stopword Removal**: Optional removal of common words that may not contribute to the analysis.
